I'm a dedicated scientist and bioinformatician based in Thuringia, Germany. I hold a PhD in Biomathematics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology from Friedrich Schiller University Jena and a Master's in Genetics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Bioinformatician at the Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI), where I manage datasets and computational pipelines, conduct research on cellular senescence, and apply advanced machine learning models to solve complex classification problems. My work contributes to a deeper understanding of aging and disease mechanisms.

With prior experience at 3DMedcare, Novogene, and BGI Genomics, I have developed bioinformatics pipelines for precision oncology and tumor immunotherapy, as well as conducted whole-genome sequencing and mitochondrial genome analysis. My core skills include Shinyapp, Git, and GitHub.

I am passionate about leveraging bioinformatics to make significant improvements in healthcare and research. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/healix-loo-1a6566225/) to explore potential collaborations.
